# Database project

This repo contains my delivery to the project in the NTNU course `TDT4145 Datamodellering og databasesystemer`. The repo was made public the day the project was submitted.

## Running the code

The following terminal commands assume you are in the `Database-project` directory.

First you need to activate the python virtual enviroment.

For CMD:

```shell script
Scripts\activate.bat
```

For bash:

```shell script
source Scripts/activate
```

Second you just need to run the main.py file:

```shell script
python src/main.py
```

With the virtual enviroment active all dependencies should be taken care of
